            <ol>
                <li>Volatility and Market Risks:</li>
                    <p>Global financial markets are highly volatile, and prices can fluctuate significantly within short periods. The AI trading services provided by NeuxFx are subject to market conditions, including sudden price movements, liquidity constraints, and regulatory changes. These factors can impact trading outcomes and may result in potential financial losses.</p>
                <li>Automated Trading:</li>
                    <p>NeuxFx employs automated trading algorithms that execute trades based on predefined parameters and market conditions. While AI technologies aim to optimize trading strategies, it is important to understand that automated trading involves inherent risks. Unexpected market events, technical failures, or algorithmic errors may occur, leading to unintended consequences, including substantial losses.</p>
                <li>No Guarantees of Profit:</li>
                    <p>While NeuxFx employs advanced AI technologies and trading strategies, there is no guarantee of profit or specific investment outcomes.

                <li>Losses and Financial Obligations:</li>
                    <p>Trading carries the risk of financial loss. Users should only invest funds that they can afford to lose. Users are responsible for monitoring their account balances, ensuring sufficient funds are available, and meeting any financial obligations resulting from trading activities, including transaction fees, margin requirements, and taxes.</p>
                <li>Regulatory Considerations:</li>
                    <p>Trading regulations and legal frameworks vary across jurisdictions. Users are responsible for understanding and complying with applicable laws and regulations relevant to their country of residence. NeuxFx does not provide legal or financial advice, and users should consult appropriate professionals for guidance in this regard.</p>
                <li>Limitation of Liability: </li>
                    <p>NeuxFx, its affiliates, employees, and agents shall not be liable for any losses, damages, costs, or expenses, including but not limited to direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from the use of our AI trading services.</p>
                <li>Individual Responsibility:</li>
                    <p>Users are solely responsible for making their own investment decisions, managing their trading accounts, and assuming the risks associated with trading activities. It is essential to conduct personal research, seek professional advice when necessary, and consider personal financial circumstances before engaging in any trading activities.</p>
                    <p>By using NeuxFx AI trading services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to the terms of this Risk Disclaimer. You understand the risks associated with trading and accept full responsibility for your trading decisions and outcomes.</p>
